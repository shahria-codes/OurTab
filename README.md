## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
- **Google Sign-In** via Firebase Authentication.
- **Protected Routes** — unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
- **Persistent Sessions** across page refreshes.
- **Permission-based Access** — only house members can view expenses, and only owners can edit them within a 48-hour window.

### 🏠 House Management
- **Named Households** — create or join a house via invite.
- **Role System** — **Managers** can update member settings (Rent, Role) and approve requests. **Members** have standard access.
- **Manager Promotion** — dynamic role switching; if a non-creator manager promotes someone else, they revert to member status.
- **Meal Management** — toggle "Meals On/Off" with a manager approval flow and automatic transition periods.
- **Fund Deposits & Refunds** — members can deposit funds into the house account (e.g., for rent or utilities), requiring manager verification. Includes support for **Refunded Deposits** when members leave.
- **Collaborative Deletion** — house deletion requires approval from all members to prevent accidental data loss.

### 📊 Financial Dashboard
- **Real-time Overview** — total house expenses vs. your personal monthly spending.
- **Smart Settlements** — automated calculation of who owes whom, optimized to minimize transaction count.
- **Expense History** — browse recent expenses or navigate through previous months with ease.
- **Currency Support** — configurable house currency ($, ₹, £, etc.).
- **PDF Export** — generate professional expense reports with one click (via jsPDF).

### 🧾 Shopping & Expenses
- **Multi-Contributor Splitting** — split bills by absolute amounts or percentages.
- **Shortcut Actions** — "I Pay All" or "Split Equally" for rapid entry.
- **Interactive Buy List** — shared list with auto-capitalization and check-off history.
- **✨ Smart Auto-Mark** — when an expense is added (e.g., "Bread"), the matching item on the buy list is automatically ticked.
- **🤖 AI Receipt Scanner** — extract items and prices directly from receipts using Google Gemini AI.
- **📸 HEIC/HEIF Support** — seamless upload and conversion of iPhone photos.
- **Cleanup Automation** — completed items auto-delete after 12 hours, with a 5-minute safety window for accidental unmarking.

## 🔔 Notifications System

OurTab keeps the whole house in sync with real-time, categorized alerts:

- **🛒 Shopping Alerts** — notified when housemates add items to the Buy List.
- **🧾 Expense Alerts** — stay updated whenever a new bill is added or an old one is edited.
- **💳 Payment & Funds** — alerts for payment requests, approval of fund deposits, or settled debts.
- **🏠 House Management** — notifications for new members joining, role changes (promoted to Manager), or house deletion requests.
- **🍽️ Meal Requests** — managers are notified when a member requests to turn off their meals for upcoming days.
- **🎂 Special Occasions** — automated birthday reminders for house members.
- **🔊 Live Feedback** — visual "pulse" indicators for unread alerts and custom notification sounds.

- Only house members can access a house's expenses and todos
- Only the expense owner can edit/delete their own expense
- Only the house creator can initiate deletion
